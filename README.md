# My git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh workspace

This repository is my workspace for experimenting with SSH signing keys as a part of [git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh) where I experimented with the following exercises:

1. [Setup workstation](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/blob/main/exercises/01-setup-workstation.md)
1. [Signing and verifying commits](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/blob/main/exercises/02-sign-verify-commits.md)
1. [Signing and verifying merges](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/blob/main/exercises/03-sign-verify-merges.md)
1. [Signing and verifying tags](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/blob/main/exercises/04-sign-verify-tags.md)
1. [Signing past commits and tags](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/blob/main/exercises/05-sign-past-commits-tags.md)


## Hello world!

The `v1.0.0` release contains the `hello-world.sh` script, which understandably displays `Hello world!`.
